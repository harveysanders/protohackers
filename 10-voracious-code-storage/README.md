**Voracious Code Storage** is a version control system accessed over the Internet. Clients can insert and retrieve text files. Each revision of a file is identified by its filename and a revision number.

Your job is to implement a VCS server.

The only known implementation has been lost, apart from a **trial copy** that remains available at **vcs.protohackers.com** on **port 30307**, which you may like to experiment with as part of your reverse engineering effort. The trial copy has the following limitations:

- it is very slow
- there is a low limit on maximum file size
- each session gets its own private temporary storage, instead of a shared global persistent storage

Your server must not have these limitations.

Sadly nobody knows how the protocol works, no client implementation exists, and no documentation is available.

Good luck!

## Reverse Engineered Spec

- Each message is delimited by a newline `\n`.
- Messages should be interpreted as ASCII
- Each client message begins with a _method_ defined below:

### Methods

#### `GET`:

#### `PUT`:

`PUT` messages consist of the following parts, separated by a single space ` ` character. The first line of a `PUT` message is the header, which contains the `PUT`, _filepath_, and _content-length_. The subsequent line contains the file contents and should be the same length as _content-length_ in the header.

| Description                                   | Type     | Ex. value   |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| method                                        | `string` | `PUT`       |
| filepath                                      | `string` | `/test.txt` |
| file content length (including trailing `\n`) | `int`    | `3`         |
| file content                                  | `string` | `hi\n`      |

Ex:

```
PUT /test.txt 6\nhello\n
```

The server should respond with an `OK` followed by the _revision number_.

#### Revision Number

A _revision number_ begins with a `r` followed by an `int`. Revision numbers start at `r1`. Each `PUT` to the same _filepath_ increments the revision number.

### Example Session

Client messages denoted with `<--`. Server responses denoted with `-->`.

```
--> READY\n
<-- PUT /test.txt 14\n
<-- hello, world!\n
--> OK r1\n
<-- PUT /test.txt 17\n
<-- Â¡hola, la gente!\n
--> OK r2\n
<-- GET /text.txt r1
--> OK 14
--> hello, world!\n
```
